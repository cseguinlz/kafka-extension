= KAFKA-EXTENSION

== WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT

This is a dependency which provides some functionality to read `Span` list from `Zipkin` as `Opentracing`
implementation which come from messages of `Kafka` topics, serializing and deserializing the content
which allows us to make an abstraction from common work across the requirement of this feature in your project.


== WHY THIS NEW DEPENDENCY

Working in observability feature in conjunction with `Spring Boot` project, which comes with `micrometer` as metrics
provider which lets push them into a kafka topic to be consumed by tools to monitor the traffic with the `Opentracing`
standard, such as `Zipkin`, `Jaeger`, `OpenCensus`, etc. But they can also be observed by other some other custom tools.

Reading this metrics, we might find spans which alert us from dysfunction in the services or the network.
